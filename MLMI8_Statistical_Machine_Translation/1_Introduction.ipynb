    ">* **Translation:** interpretaion of the meaning of a text and the subsequent production of an equivalent text that communicates the same message in another language\n",
    ">* **Interpretation:** the intellectual activity that consists of facilitating oral or sign-language communication, either simultaneously or consecutively, between two or among three or more speakers who are not speaking, or signing, the same language\n",
